# BayesianDecisionWeights

Decision Making Exam for Cognitive Science Masters.

## Project Description

Pipeline for experimental validation of the idea
that Prospect Theory's (PT) S-shaped weighting function
is modulated by the affect of risky choices
(Rottenstreich & Hsee, 2001).

This pipeline is a suggestion for how their initial
(and convincing) findings can be tested more rigorously.

### Study 1

First, it is proposed that a range of questions (10)
are evaluated based on their affective value.
Participants in this study will evaluate the
emotional value on a scale of 0-100 with a slider.

### Study 2

Second, decisions under varying levels
of uncertainty are made related to these
questions, and the
certainty equivalence (CE) is found for
each combination of these for each participant.
The value of a gamble to a participant is again
indicated with a slider.

Then the two parameters, gamma and delta (Gonzales & Wu, 1999), are
estimated for each question.

Support for the original proposition of Rottenstreich &
Hsee will consist of estimated gamma being higher
for high-affect items.
